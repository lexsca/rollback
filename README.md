Rollback
========

A simple Pythonic mechanism for rolling back multiple operations in a
predictable way, either as a context manager or a standalone instance.
By default, errors are re-raised, but an explicit mode or call *must*
be supplied to trigger a rollback. Valid modes are:

* `onError`  Boolean when `True` will roll back if an error is raised
* `onSuccess` Boolean when `True` will roll back if an error is _not_ raised

Both modes can be set to `True` to always rollback. A rollback can also be
triggered manually by calling `doRollback`. Errors can be supressed by
setting `raiseError` to `False`.  Note that errors from rollback steps
will not be surpressed.  This ensures at a minimum that the calls within
the context manager _or_ the rollback steps succeeded.

If a rollback is triggered, each step is called in a last in, first out
order (LIFO).  That is, the most recently added step is called first,
the first step is called last.

### Compatibility

Rollback was tested with the following versions of Python
* 2.6.9
* 2.7.13
* 3.3.6
* 3.4.6
* 3.5.3
* 3.6.1

### Installation

```
python setup.py install
```

### Example usage

```python
from __future__ import print_function

from rollback import Rollback

# *always* rollback after exiting block, letting any error be re-raised
with Rollback(onError=True, onSuccess=True) as rollback:
  print('do a1')
  rollback.addStep(print, 'undo a1')
  print('do a2')
  rollback.addStep(print, 'undo a2')

# rollback *only* if *no* error is raised, letting any error be re-raised
with Rollback(onSuccess=True) as rollback:
  print('do b1')
  rollback.addStep(print, 'undo b1')
  print('do b2')
  rollback.addStep(print, 'undo b2')

# rollback manually
with Rollback() as rollback:
  print('do c1')
  rollback.addStep(print, 'undo c1')
  print('do c2')
  rollback.addStep(print, 'undo c2')
  rollback.doRollback()

# rollback *only* if an error is raised, suppressing the error
with Rollback(onError=True, raiseError=False) as rollback:
  print('do d1')
  rollback.addStep(print, 'undo d1')
  print('do d2')
  rollback.addStep(print, 'undo d2')
  raise RuntimeError('this is not re-raised')

# rollback *only* if an error is raised, letting the error be re-raised
with Rollback(onError=True) as rollback:
  print('do e1')
  rollback.addStep(print, 'undo e1')
  print('do e2')
  rollback.addStep(print, 'undo e2')
  raise RuntimeError('this is re-raised')
```
Produces output:
```
do a1
do a2
undo a2
undo a1
do b1
do b2
undo b2
undo b1
do c1
do c2
undo c2
undo c1
do d1
do d2
undo d2
undo d1
do e1
do e2
undo e2
undo e1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "example.py", line 41, in <module>
    raise RuntimeError('this is re-raised')
RuntimeError: this is re-raised
```
